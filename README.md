Suppose you wish to open a bank account or get a liveness certificate from a bank through a video call with a bank officer. Build a system that can help the bank (verifier) establish your identity (resident) without accessing the biometric authentication platforms of UIDAI. In particular, the resident shares the offline eKYC document (available in XML format) with the verifying agency for validation. The verifier will use the photo taken through the video call and match it against the photo available in the eKYC document. The verifier application can use the headless face authentication APK of UIDAI to validate the eKYC document in a completely offline (not connected to UIDAI backend systems) manner for genuineness and authenticity using face match technology.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56642942/139587887-37fbbe4c-7973-46e0-94cf-860c8a36d7ab.png)
